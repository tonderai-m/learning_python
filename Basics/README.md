Welcome to my playground where I practice python and have fun;
This is purely my personal space and for joy only;

packages contains commonly used functions in func and functions 

you need to export path every time you use it to register in the python library to access them 
in any directory 

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:..../packages/func
