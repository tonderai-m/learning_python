      "The \"with\" statement\n",
      "********************\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"with\" statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with\n",
      "methods defined by a context manager (see section With Statement\n",
      "Context Managers). This allows common \"try\"…\"except\"…\"finally\" usage\n",
      "patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "   with_stmt          ::= \"with\" ( \"(\" with_stmt_contents \",\"? \")\" | with_stmt_contents ) \":\" suite\n",
      "   with_stmt_contents ::= with_item (\",\" with_item)*\n",
      "   with_item          ::= expression [\"as\" target]\n",
      "\n",
      "The execution of the \"with\" statement with one “item” proceeds as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The context expression (the expression given in the \"with_item\") is\n",
      "   evaluated to obtain a context manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The context manager’s \"__enter__()\" is loaded for later use.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The context manager’s \"__exit__()\" is loaded for later use.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The context manager’s \"__enter__()\" method is invoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. If a target was included in the \"with\" statement, the return value\n",
      "   from \"__enter__()\" is assigned to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Note:\n",
      "\n",
      "     The \"with\" statement guarantees that if the \"__enter__()\" method\n",
      "     returns without an error, then \"__exit__()\" will always be\n",
      "     called. Thus, if an error occurs during the assignment to the\n",
      "     target list, it will be treated the same as an error occurring\n",
      "     within the suite would be. See step 7 below.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The suite is executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The context manager’s \"__exit__()\" method is invoked.  If an\n",
      "   exception caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and\n",
      "   traceback are passed as arguments to \"__exit__()\". Otherwise, three\n",
      "   \"None\" arguments are supplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "   If the suite was exited due to an exception, and the return value\n",
      "   from the \"__exit__()\" method was false, the exception is reraised.\n",
      "   If the return value was true, the exception is suppressed, and\n",
      "   execution continues with the statement following the \"with\"\n",
      "   statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "   If the suite was exited for any reason other than an exception, the\n",
      "   return value from \"__exit__()\" is ignored, and execution proceeds\n",
